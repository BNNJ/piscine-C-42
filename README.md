# piscine C de 42

DO NOT BLINDLY COPY WHAT'S IN THERE !  
I finished the piscine already, got accepted, and now i'm redoing it all over again to try to find solutions to the exercices i didn't do, and better solutions to the ones i did.  
Everything works with my tests, but i might have missed exceptions or issues.  
Some of them don't respect the norme, mostly because of functions bigger than 25 lines.
